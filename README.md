```

## Before usage

To get started with the SDK, you'll need:
* **userName** - The login of the vendor's service account; 
* **password** - Password of the vendor account;
* **token** â€“ The value that is used to authenticate the merchant when sending requests to the payment gateway. You do not need to pass the `userName` and `password` parameters when passing this parameter. To obtain a public key, contact technical support.

These values are issued in your personal account after connecting to [Sberbank Internet Acquiring][acquiring].

SDK allows you to configure operating mode (debug / prod), by default - debug.
The SDK also allows you to configure request proxying, by default all requests go to Sberbank servers.

To configure the operation mode, set the following parameters:
```dart
final SberbankAcquiring acquiring = SberbankAcquiring(
  SberbankAcquiringConfig(
    userName: userName,
    password: password,
    debug: false,
  ),
);
```

If you want to use `token`, use the following constructor:
```dart
final SberbankAcquiring acquiring = SberbankAcquiring(
  SberbankAcquiringConfig.token(
    token: token,
  ),
);
```

If you want to use a `proxy`, use the following constructor:
```dart
final SberbankAcquiring acquiring = SberbankAcquiring(
  SberbankAcquiringConfig.proxy(
    proxyUrl: 'https://server.com/',
  ),
);
```
